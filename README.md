## Problem Statement

India faces a critical food paradox: 40% of food is wasted annually, while 190 million people go hungry every day. This issue is caused by inefficient agriculture, fragmented supply chains, and the absence of real-time tools for managing surplus.

### Key Challenges

1. **Food Wastage:**

   - 68 million tons of food wasted annually, enough to feed 100 million people.
   - Nearly 40% of food is lost before reaching consumers, including significant waste from restaurants, buffets, and retailers.

2. **Hunger and Malnutrition:**

   - India ranks 94th on the Global Hunger Index.
   - 190 million Indians go hungry daily; 1 in 4 children suffers from malnutrition.

3. **Economic Loss:**

   - ‚Çπ2 lakh crore (1.5% of GDP) lost annually due to food waste.

4. **Environmental Impact:**
   - Food waste accounts for 6% of India‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions.
